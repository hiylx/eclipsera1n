# Troubleshooting

If you want to do this script manually, follow Orangera1n's guide
Link to it is here:
https://gist.github.com/Orangera1n/fa3ca03d6aa9f5be963fd3b72c3f4225

Also few thing need to be fixed in that guide:

In guide it says to do this: <br>
<code>ldid -e /mnt8/usr/libexec/mobileactivationd > ents.xml </code> <br>
Command that you need to enter is:<br>
<code>ldid -e /mnt8/usr/libexec/mobileactivationd > /mnt8/ents.xml </code>

If you run into any issues it is recommended to use it to troubleshoot, if you need help with it contact me or make new thread in Discord server

Also please don't ping me more than once, thanks
