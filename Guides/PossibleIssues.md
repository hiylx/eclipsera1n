# Possible issues when using this script

## 1. Unable to sign in into iCloud
This issue happened to me when i was doing this script for first time, but in second try it worked flawlessly, also only issue i noticed is Passwords crashing when opened in settings.

## 2. Man in the middle attack
This issue happens when known_hosts weren't reseted after changing between OpenSSH and ./sshrd ssh

## 3. Can't jailbreak anymore
If you have set passcode you will have to restore since it has iOS 16 SEP and it requires to do that

## Disclamer
This script is for educational purposes. I am aware people might use this to bypass iCloud, but I am NOT encouraging you to bypass iCloud and you **shouldn't do that**. This guide is **legitimately** activating it!
ALSO: This script is for advanced users, i am not responsible if your device becomes broken (idk how but just in case)
