# FutureRestoring A11 Guide

# Prerequsites
1. A computer running macOS
2. A11 device(iPhone X **isn't** supported)
3. Patience

# Disclamer
This script is for educational purposes. I am aware people might use this to bypass iCloud, but I am NOT encouraging you to bypass iCloud and you **shouldn't do that**. This guide is **legitametly** activating it!
ALSO: This script is for advanced users, i am not responsable if your device becomes broken (idk how but just in case)

# Usage
1. Clone and cd into this repository: `git clone https://github.com/kjutzn/cry-ptex1 --recursive && cd cry-ptex1`
    - If you have cloned this before, run `cd cry-ptex1 && git pull` to pull new changes
2. Run `./preparing.sh `
3. After it finishes run `./activate.sh`

# Have in mind before using
1. If you are already on iOS 15.0-15.4.1 or any 14.x version, i wouldn't advise you to use this script, check [PossibleIssues.md](https://github.com/kjutzn/cry-ptex1/blob/main/Guides/PossibleIssues.md) in Guides folder
2. Also if signing in into iCloud doesn't work try grabing new activation files(from latest iOS 16 version) and redoing whole script
