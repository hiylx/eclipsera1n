# Prerequsites
1. A computer running macOS
2. A11 device (No point of using this on a10 and less)

I am very aware people might use this to bypass icloud, but I am NOT encouraging you to bypass iCloud.
ALSO: THIS IS RECOMMENDED FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY, i am not responsable if your device becomes broken (idk how but just in case)
