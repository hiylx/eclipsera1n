# Prerequsites

This script is for educational purposes. I am aware people might use this to bypass iCloud, but I am NOT encouraging you to bypass iCloud and you **shouldn't do that**. This guide is **legitametly** activating it!

ALSO: This script is for advanced users, i am not responsable if your device becomes broken (idk how but just in case)

# Usage

    - If you have cloned this before, run `cd cry-ptex1 && git pull` to pull new changes
